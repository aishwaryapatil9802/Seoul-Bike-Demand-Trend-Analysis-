The Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset consists of 8,760 hourly records, capturing the number of bikes rented along with various influencing factors such as time, weather conditions, and seasonal variations. It includes data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and precipitation, along with information on holidays and whether it was a functioning rental day. This dataset is useful for analyzing trends, understanding the impact of environmental factors on bike usage, and optimizing bike-sharing systems.

Before visualize any data from the data set, we will do the data cleaning as to fill any null values and delete any duplicated values, after that we will do data wrangling.

Also we will do data analysis for Seoul Bike. we also take help of charts for better analysis.
